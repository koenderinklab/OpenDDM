separate out frames into an array of nxn 16-bit matrices
infer the framerate from the metadata

pick one value for tau >= 1/framerate:
	iterate through frames to get I(x, t+ tau)-I(x,t) for that tau (this will be an nxnxt array, where t is number of frames)
	Fourier transform those I(x, t+tau) - I(x,t) in space
	result is I(q, t+tau) - I(q, t)
	square that
	average over all t
	repeat for next value of tau

final result will be g(q, tau)
